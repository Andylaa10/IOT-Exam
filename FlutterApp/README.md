# IOT-Exam
This is an exam project in Internet of things (IOT),
which is one of the chosen elective courses on 4th semester.
We have made a smart door lock, which sends information to flespi mqtt and adafruit io.
Adafruit io controls the smart door lock, and flespi mqtt receives data based on the state of the door lock.
As a nice to have we have made a fairly simple flutter app which sends post request to adafruit io,
so the state of the smart door lock can be changed through the app.
